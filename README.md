# **JoeTracks.com — Guides & Planning Tools**

JoeTracks.com is a practical outdoor resource hub built around **field-tested guides** and **lightweight planning tools**.  
The focus is simple: help people make better decisions about time outside — access, logistics, conditions, and route choices.

🌐 **Live Site:** https://joetracks.com

---

## **Overview**

JoeTracks is designed for **real-world use**, not content overload.

The site combines:

- **Field Guides** — Detailed, experience-driven writeups from real trips
- **Planning Tools** — Browser-based utilities for faster decisions
- **Clear Systems** — Practical workflows that reduce guesswork

While the project was formerly structured as a full-stack portfolio, that portfolio still exists and is accessible via the footer.

## **What Lives Here**

### **Field Guides**

Long-form, structured guides built from direct experience:

- Route beta & terrain considerations
- Access & logistics notes
- Gear decisions & lessons learned
- Visual references tied directly to text

These are written to be useful for planning, not just inspirational.

---

### **Planning Tools**

Simple browser-based utilities designed to reduce friction:

- No accounts
- No installs
- Immediate usability

Example: **Michigan Ski Tracker**, which parses NOAA data to provide resort-specific snowfall estimates.

---

## **Philosophy**

JoeTracks prioritizes:

- **Clarity over hype**
- **Systems over noise**
- **Practicality over abstraction**

The goal is helping people spend more time outside with fewer bad assumptions.

---

## **Tech Stack**

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- React Router
- Cloudflare Pages

The site intentionally favors a **lightweight, fast, static-first architecture**.

---

## **Notes**

JoeTracks.com is an evolving project.

Upcoming directions include:

- Expanded regional guide libraries
- Additional planning utilities
- Decision-support tooling
