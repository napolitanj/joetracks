            I'm Joe Napolitan, a Michigan-based Technical Support Specialist,
            web developer, and former wilderness educator & ski patroller. Over
            the past decade, I’ve led backcountry expeditions in Alaska, worked
            various roles in the technology industry, taught outdoor skills to
            underserved youth, and later pivoted into tech through self-teaching
            and certifications. Today I work full-time in IT at a creative arts
            school, where I support staff and students while building tools to
            automate workflows, manage data, and improve systems. I bring a mix
            of technical skill, hands-on grit, and people-first problem-solving
            to everything I do.
          </p>

            What ties it all together is my drive to build things that are
            useful and real, whether its an itinerary for an awesome backpacking
            trip, a better process, or a meaningful life outside the status
            race. I’m always exploring ways to work smarter, live simpler, and
            help others do the same. This site showcases some of my personal
            projects and creative experiments across tech, content, and the
            outdoors.
